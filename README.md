# Project: SmartPiggies

An open source standard for a free peer-to-peer global derivatives market.
- 

SmartPiggies are non-fungible digital contracts that provide their owners with protection against undesirable changes in the price of any asset, product, or service. They also have a native self-auctioning mechanism that allows them to globally market themselves, eliminating the need for exchanges.

Historically, centralized authorities and rent collecting intermediaries have been  necessary due the trust and guarantees they inject into modern financial commitments. Today, with the guarantees provided by the Ethereum network and recent innovations provided by the global community, it is now possible to create robust programmable digital assets linked to the real world prices that have no dependencies on centralized authorities or intermediaries.

SmartPiggies are an example of simple, useful, globally accessible, peer-to-peer financial agreements that can exist on the Ethereum network today.

## What we built for EthNewYork


### ChainLink Custom Adaptor Implementation

Problem 1: SmartPiggies, along with most contracts in general, are contingent on future events. Basic oracle functionality responds to current requests with current data. This results in a poor user experience as a contract lifecycle workflow in certain circumstances may require a user to undertake an action in the future 

Solution 1: Chainlink via Custom Adaptor technology

Problem 2:
